# Dog/Cat Classifier

This python application will connect with a NASA API. I intend to show how to connect with APIs with python.

## Getting Started
I will use the requests module and 

The untar_data function takes a URL as an argument. It will download and extract the data.


### Prerequisites


For the learning step the of the neural networks you will need to run linux on a system with an NVIDIA GPU (CUDA capable GPU). There are ways around the GPU requirement, put they are extremely slow in comparison. 

I specifically used Linux Ubuntu on a dual-boot PC that I purchased and set up myself. 

Once ubuntu is installed, you must install Fastai, vscode, Kindle and sublime. 

Kindle installation for ubuntu is a bit tricky, because the at the time of installation the latest version did not work with ubuntu, and a previous version was required. 

Kindle is needed to follow along with the Fastai book and course.

Anaconda is also required to get the necessary dependencies

### Installing
Details and instructions for the Anaconda installation on linux are at: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

An explanation of the Fastai installation can be found at: https://github.com/fastai/fastai1/blob/master/README.md#installation

Sublime installation instructions are at:

## Running the tests

Testing will be performed locally before deployment.


## Deployment

I will attempt to deploy on a Bluehost VPS running Centos.

## Built With

*  fastai.vision.all
*  nbdev.showdoc
*  matplotlib
 

## Versioning

Github was used for versioning. For the versions available, see https://github.com/scottcm73/dog_cat_classifier


## Author

* The original authors are Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. 


However, I will attempt to deploy the saved model on a system without a gpu once the learning is accomplished. 
* **Scott McMahan** -- will be the author of the deployed version.
